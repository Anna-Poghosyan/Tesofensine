                            <h3>PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</h3>
                            <p>
                                <br>Losing weight... is easier said than done! What kind of physical activity is best suited for me? How should I practise it? How often and for how
                                <br>long should I do it?
                                <br>There are many questions around this issue and some might scare a lot of people. Here are some tips on <b>losing weight by exercising</b>. Avoid violent efforts. Walking is excellent: you have to walk at least 600 meters, every day, on a flat ground, in the beginning of the treatment.
                            </p>
                            <h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>
                            <p>
                                If you live in the countryside and only half a mile from the bakery, consider walking or riding a bike. If you live in the city, get off one or two stops before your destination.
                            </p>
                            <h3>A MATTER OF BALANCE</h3>
                            <p>
                                It is often said that in order to <b>lose weight,</b> one must practise physical activity regularly.
                                <br>However, even though exercise is essential for <b>weight loss</b>, it may not be enough to quickly eliminate those extra pounds. To be truly effective, physical activity must be combined not with a diet, but with a nutritional rebalancing. Similarly, this rebalancing alone is not always enough to lose weight. Due to its pharmacological properties, which decrease/control the appetite, tesofensine you will create this balance.
                            </p>
                            <h3>NUTRITION</h3>
                            <p>You must learn to rebalance yourself day after day. For example, try keeping a food diary. Spend more time preparing your meals. Also, don't think about the diet as a frustration. You can still eat the foods you enjoy but not anyway nor at any time. Avoid foods with high content of animal fat and salt.
                                <br>Drink plenty of water and often. Itâ€™s extremely important for the treatment to work that you drink nothing but plain water between meals.</p>
                            <h3>WEIGHT MEMORY</h3>
                            <p>We are genetically programmed to reach a certain weight in adulthood.
                                <br>The brain is responsible for maintaining this weight in adulthood through several mechanisms. Under certain circumstances associated with the conditions of modern life, such as junk food and a sedentary lifestyle, the brain may no longer be able to maintain this weight and it will allow it to increase. Subsequently, the brain will register this new weight and it will implement the same regulatory mechanisms to maintain the new weight.
                                <br>This phenomenon is well known among overweight individuals after following a diet. It happens when they recover their lost pounds after the slightest slip. This is called the yo-yo effect.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                To avoid this, after you attain the ideal weight with the treatment, you must allow time for the brain to register this new weight to maintain. This period lasts approximately between 10 to 12 months. During this period you must continue treatment by taking a half tablet per day. You must also develop healthy eating habits, such as having three balanced meals a day and drinking nothing but water between them. It is crucial that you use the ideal weight to create a daily work out by simply changing habits, like getting off one underground stop before your destination or exiting the lift two floors below in order to walk the rest of the way.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In case your body mass index (BMI) exceeds 25 you should follow a treatment of 1 or a half tablet of tesofensine per day. Do not wait until you get to 30.</p>
